    "Agents in a swarm have two main goals: to stay close to other agents and not to bump into other agents. The first goal involves defining a 'cohesion' field, $C_b$, for each agent $b$. The cohesion field of $b$ is specified as a circle of given radius, centred at $b$. Any agent $b'$ that is positioned within the cohesion field of $b$ inclines $b$ to move towards $b'$. The second goal involves defining a 'repulsion' field, $R_b$, in a similar manner to the definition of the cohesion field. Any agent $b'$ that is positioned within the repulsion field of $b$ inclines $b$ to move away from $b'$. Notice that an agent $b'$ that is positioned both within  $b$'s cohesion field *and* its repulsion field will cause $b$ to have conflicting inclinations: both to move towards and to move away from $b'$. The final movement of $b$ depends on the 'strength' of these inclinations.\n",

    "So far, we have considered only swarms in which all agents are within the cohesion and repulsion fields of each other. It is very unlikely that this will be the case in general. It is only the agents that are within the cohesion and repulsion fields of another agent that can have an effect on its behaviour. Therefore, it is important to be able to determine, for any agent, which agents are within these fields. We begin by computing the pairwise distances between agents, given a 2-D array modelling the current state of the swarm, in which row 0 gives the x-coordinates and row 1 gives the y-coordinates of each agent."
